# PigGameJS

Pig Game is a 2 Player game where a player's goal is to reach 100 points before the other.
A dice is rolled, which will stop and output a corresponding number. That number will then 
be added to the current score until the player stops rolling. 

If the player rolls a Number 1,the accumulated scores will be forfeited and the turn will 
go to the next player. if no Number 1 is rolled and the player chose to Hold, the score will 
be added to the Total Score.

JavaScript Program created by me. HTML and CSS base code were provided from a course instructor 
with improvements and modifications made by me.
